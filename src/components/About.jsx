      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I began with no real-world experience, but through my ALX training and
        internship at FlexiSAF, I gained hands-on skills in JavaScript (ES6),
        React, Context API, Git & GitHub. Alongside my passion for teaching, Iâ€™m
        now focused on frontend development and excited to keep learning and
        creating impactful solutions with technology.
